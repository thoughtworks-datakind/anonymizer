# Data Protection Framework
Data Protection Framework is a python library/command line application for identification, anonymization and de-anonymization of Personally Identifiable Information data.

The framework aims to work on a two-fold principle for detecting PII:
1. Using RegularExpressions using a pattern
2. Using NLP for detecting NER (Named Entity Recognitions)
 
## Features and Current Status

### Completed
 * Following Global detectors have been completed:
   * [x] EMAIL_ADDRESS :  An email address identifies the mailbox that emails are sent to or from. The maximum length of the domain name is 255 characters, and the maximum length of the local-part is 64 characters.
   * [x] CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER : A credit card number is 12 to 19 digits long. They are used for payment transactions globally.
 
 * Following detectors specific to Singapore have been completed:
   * [x] PHONE_NUMBER : A telephone number.
   * [x] FIN/NRIC : A unique set of nine alpha-numeric characters on the Singapore National Registration Identity Card.
 
 * Following anonymizers have been added
    * [x] Redaction: Deletes all or part of a detected sensitive value.
    * [x] Encryption :  Encrypts the original sensitive data value using a cryptographic key. Cloud DLP supports several types of tokenization, including transformations that can be reversed, or "re-identified."

### TO-DO
Following features  are part of the backlog with more features coming soon
 * Detectors:
    * [ ] NAME
    * [ ] ADDRESS
 * Anonymizers:
    * [ ] Masking: Replaces a number of characters of a sensitive value with a specified surrogate character, such as a hash (#) or asterisk (*).
    * [ ] Bucketing: "Generalizes" a sensitive value by replacing it with a range of values. (For example, replacing a specific age with an age range, 
    or temperatures with ranges corresponding to "Hot," "Medium," and "Cold.")
    * [ ] Replacement: Replaces a detected sensitive value with a specified surrogate value.
